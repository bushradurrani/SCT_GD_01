For my first task as a Graphic Design Intern at SkillCraft Technology, I created a marketing campaign for an imaginary brand, Starloft, centered around World Space Week (Oct 4-Oct 10). The campaign promotes the 'Starship Supply Box,' a space-themed subscription box for hobbyists and explorers. I enjoyed blending creativity with branding strategies to design this poster and capture the excitement of space exploration. Looking forward to more projects ahead!
